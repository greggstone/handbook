# Design project templates

Designers at Sourcegraph use design project templates to help standardize their workflow and record artifacts generated during the design process. This record of the process serves as a place for anyone who making a decision about the product can go to learn about how the feature evoolved.

It is important to note that a template is not a prescriptive set of requirements for a project. As each project is different, teams will determine the best route to success and alter a fitting template according to the agreed upon scope of an effort. Determining the scope design needs for a project requires teams weigh several factors:

* The amount of risk involved in the feature
* The confidence the designer and team have in a proposed solution or hypothesis
* The amount of time and resources available to produce a solution
* The projectâ€™s potential value to the business
